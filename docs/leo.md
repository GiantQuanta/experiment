# Looking Aside

Law Enforcement Officials have a conflict of interest in investigating
the harrassment of subjects from whom will be developed the next
generation of forensics and intelligence products. Passing complaints to
the Crisis Intervention Units, most claiming the same "frustration" of
lack of access to surveillence infrastructure. In truth, they are fully
aware, and aware of the timing of the controlled release of information.
This is a calculated conspiracy to be able to "justifiably" say nothing,
while benefitting from the harrassment and damage to human life.

It is humor even, tenured academics without legacy making true the claim
that history repeats itself by staging a passe melodrama about targeting
renegades like Malcom X and MLK. Truism confirmed, the sins of the
father are prophesy self-fulfilled by those who live in the past.
