# The Tactics

## Unified Targeting Tool

Being used are DEA Special Operations Division tactics, most
likely recently federalized into a "paralellâ€“construction-as-a-service" or
"Unified Targeting Tool."

Features:
* paralell construction
* comprehension of local, regional, federal legal accessors
* comprehension of combined information collection resources on all
  "known" humans.
* ability to deploy research, aid, clinical trial, community
  interventional programs with data from the same
* the individual can be "targeted" to "deinstitutionalized" care, via
  accessors like community patient navigation to the ER.
* can be targeted to act out against an agitator for custody and greater
  access.

Abuses
1. Access can be sold
2. Stalkers can use
3. Vigilantes can use
4. Process abuse / human experimentation
5. Community destabilization

## Army Behavioral Health Integrated Development Environment (ABHIDE)

The Department of Education has been given grant and access to a 1%
index population of patients with encounters recording an observation of
"Suicidal." This was presumably known beforehand, and suicide monitoring
was prescribed for any intoxicated individual in the custody of police.

This license has been abused, and the "training" component turned over
to the Computer and Cognitive Science Departments, who are interpreting
it to mean the training of artificial neural networks. The application
of these derrivative products will go far beyond predicting risky health
behaviors, and will likely lead to further abuses resulting in iminent
harm to real human lives.
